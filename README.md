 The laptop given to me was made in late 1990s. I call it "GrandmaDell". 
 Can you open the case and tell me the difference between modern day laptops and old laptops?

 You need to list component by component comparison.
 
 CPU: manufactuer? More information.
+The laptop holds a 3.06GHz mobile Pentium 4 processor by Intel. While the mobile processor doesn't have as much raw power as it could, it takes considerably less power to fuel it. This would aid in the portability of the laptop, but the unit ways over 8 pounds. This kind of weight is not particularly conducive to portability. 3.06GHz is not a laughable statistic for a laptop, but its real weakness comes from its single core nature. Maybe laptops today boast a similar speed, but they also have between four and eight cores. While the number is similar, there is no comparison between this processor and modern ones.

 RAM: How big, who made it?
+The RAM is made by Kingston. There are two 1GB units in the laptop, which gives the laptop a measly total of 2GB of memory. While this may seem paltry by today's standards, the Inspiron 5150 was actually a pretty hefty worker at the time of production. Many of today's laptops have bewteen 4GB and 8GB, with desktops reaching up from 8GB all the way up to 64GB. This kind of RAM would never cut it in today's computer world.

 Hard drive: How big in terms of storage space? who made it?
+The hard drive only holds 30GB. It is made by Hitachi Global Storage Technologies in Thailand. That size hard drive is insanely small in comparison with today's technology. Most flash drives have more storage that the hard drive on this laptop. Most laptops have anywhere from 250GB up to 1TB of storage, so this size hard drive would not be acceptable on the current market.
 
 How is laptop different from desktop?
The main difference between laptops and desktops is upgradability. Laptop parts are commonly built into the motherboard. This allows them to pack more hardware in smaller space while sacrificing upgrade-ability. Desktop parts can be easily taken on and off the motherboard without a problem. Because of how close they are with the motherboard, laptop parts are very seldom repairable. You can find most desktop parts at the local store. Laptop hardware is very different in shape, size, and price compared to that of a normal desktop. Because of the efforst and resources that go into making a laptop so mobile, laptops are usually more expensive than a desktop of similar statistics. Laptops contain a rechargeable battery which gives them more mobility.

This laptop in particular is different from other laptops because it is bulkier and has an emphasis on being durable, while recent laptops are more of tablet style with a connective keyboard. The new laptop are lightweight and becoming smaller. A laptop of this size and stature would not fare well in the competitive market, because it is less powerful than a similar desktop, but it is still not as portable as most laptops.
